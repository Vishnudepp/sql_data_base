# sql_data_base
The app is an intelligent data retrieval platform powered by Google's Gemini LLM and an SQL database. It allows users to interact with the database using natural language queries. The Gemini LLM translates these queries into SQL commands, retrieves relevant data from the database, and presents it in an easy-to-understand format.

This app is ideal for users without technical expertise in SQL, providing a conversational interface for data analysis, report generation, and decision-making. It supports advanced querying, contextual understanding, and even recommends insights based on the retrieved data.
